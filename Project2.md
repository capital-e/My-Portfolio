## Project 2: Explore The Vulnerabilities

# Project Objective
The objective of this project was to create a hands-on learning environment for exploring and understanding cybersecurity vulnerabilities through ethical hacking exercises. By setting up a virtual home lab environment using VirtualBox, the project aimed to provide a safe and controlled space for practicing penetration testing techniques and simulating real-world attack scenarios. Using Kali Linux as the attack system and Metasploitable 2 as the target, the project sought to develop practical skills in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating security weaknesses to strengthen overall cybersecurity posture.

# Tools
1. VirtualBox: Utilized for creating a virtualized home lab environment to simulate networked systems for ethical hacking purposes.
2. Kali Linux: Used as the primary operating system for conducting penetration testing and ethical hacking activities, equipped with a wide range of pre-installed security tools.
3. Metasploitable 2: Configured as the target system to practice exploiting vulnerabilities and conducting penetration testing exercises.
4. Metasploit Framework: Leveraged for developing and executing exploits against vulnerable systems, enhancing proficiency in penetration testing methodologies.
5. Nmap: Employed for network reconnaissance and scanning to identify open ports, services, and potential attack vectors within the target environment.
6. Wireshark: Utilized for network traffic analysis to capture and analyze packet data, facilitating the identification of suspicious or malicious activity.

# Skills Gained
1. Vulnerability Assessment: Developed skills in identifying and assessing vulnerabilities within target systems through active reconnaissance and scanning techniques.
2. Network Traffic Analysis: Enhanced proficiency in analyzing network traffic using Wireshark to identify anomalies, potential security threats, and malicious activity.
3. Penetration Testing: Acquired hands-on experience in conducting penetration tests to identify and exploit security weaknesses in target systems, utilizing tools such as Metasploit and Nmap.
4. Ethical Hacking: Developed a solid foundation in ethical hacking principles and techniques, including reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting.
5. Documentation: Improved skills in documenting findings, vulnerabilities, and recommended solutions to enhance security awareness and facilitate the remediation of identified risks.
