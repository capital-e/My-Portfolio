## Project 1: Live Cyber Attacks of the World (Honeypot)

# Project Objective
The objective of this project was to create a live monitoring system for cyber attacks around the world using a honeypot setup. By configuring an intentionally discoverable virtual machine (VM) in Azure, the aim was to capture and analyze real-time attack data to gain insights into the geographic distribution and magnitude of cyber threats. The project aimed to enhance threat intelligence and incident response capabilities by leveraging cloud-based tools and automation to collect, analyze, and visualize attack data.

# Tools
1. Azure Cloud Platform: Utilized Azure services such as Virtual Machines, Log Analytics Workspace, and Azure Sentinel for hosting, log ingestion, and security analytics.
2. PowerShell: Developed custom PowerShell scripts to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer and forward it to a third-party API for geolocation data retrieval.
3. Log Analytics Workspace: Configured to ingest custom logs containing geographic information and perform log analysis.
4. Azure Sentinel: Microsoft's cloud SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform used for threat detection, investigation, and response.
5. Azure Sentinel Workbook: Configured to create visualizations, including a global attack map, to display real-time attack data based on physical location and attack magnitude.

# Skills Gained
1. Cloud Computing: Acquired hands-on experience in deploying and configuring resources in the Azure cloud platform, including virtual machines and log analytics workspace.
2. Log Analysis: Developed proficiency in analyzing custom logs and extracting relevant information to gain insights into cyber threats.
3. Scripting: Enhanced scripting skills through the development of custom PowerShell scripts to automate data extraction and forwarding processes.
4. Automation: Utilized automation techniques to streamline data collection and analysis processes, improving efficiency and scalability.
5. System Architecture: Gained experience in designing and implementing a system architecture for real-time monitoring and analysis of cyber attacks, including the integration of multiple Azure services for data ingestion, processing, and visualization.
