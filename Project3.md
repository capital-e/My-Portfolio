## Project 3: Centralized Visuals (SIEM)

# Project Objective
The objective of this project was to implement a centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using the Elastic Stack in order to enhance security event monitoring, threat detection, and incident response capabilities. By setting up and configuring Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment, the project aimed to develop practical skills in SIEM configuration and management, security event analysis, data visualization, alerting mechanisms, and incident response processes.

# Tools
1. Elastic Stack SIEM: Utilized for setting up and configuring the centralized SIEM solution, including Elasticsearch for data storage and indexing, Logstash for log ingestion and processing, and Kibana for data visualization and dashboard creation.
2. Kali Linux: Employed as the operating system for generating and analyzing security events, utilizing tools such as Nmap for network reconnaissance and scanning within the home lab environment.
3. Elastic Agents: Configured and deployed on Kali Linux VMs for log collection and forwarding to the Elastic SIEM for security event monitoring and analysis.

# Skills Gained
1. SIEM Configuration and Management: Demonstrated proficiency in setting up and configuring the Elastic Stack SIEM solution, including the deployment of Elastic Agents for log collection and forwarding, as well as the configuration of data sources and indices within Elasticsearch.
2. Security Event Analysis: Acquired hands-on experience in generating, collecting, and analyzing security events using tools such as Nmap on Kali Linux, and querying Elastic SIEM to identify and investigate security incidents.
3. Data Visualization: Developed skills in creating custom dashboards and visualizations in Kibana to effectively visualize and interpret security event data, facilitating the identification of trends, patterns, and anomalies.
4. Alerting Mechanisms: Successfully created and tested alert rules within Elastic SIEM for detecting specific security events, demonstrating competency in proactive incident response and alert management.
5. Incident Response: Enhanced skills in incident detection, investigation, and response processes through the use of centralized SIEM solution, contributing to improved security posture and resilience against cyber threats.
